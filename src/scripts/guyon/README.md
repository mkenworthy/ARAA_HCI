# Olivier Guyon 20pc star list

https://subarutelescope.org/staff/guyon/04research.web/14hzplanetsELTs.web/catalog.web/content.html

Downloaded `StarList.cols.txt` and `StarList_20pc.txt`


Edited `StarList_20pc.txt` to add missing star names towards the end of the list to make 29 columns

Added the names of the columns as a commented line at the head of `StarList_20pc.txt` and then wrote

`plot_snr.py`

to plot and replicate the original figure in the web page.

Using a different colorbar map to map temperature to colours, but using the size of the symbol to represent how close the star is to the Sun.

`spt_t.png` is an image of the colorbar used in the original plot.
